- Decisions:
  - [ ] Reframed the brief around the operator’s request to analyze the solution and define improvement needs without technical design.
- Open questions:
  - [ ] What is the app’s purpose, users, and current feature set?

- Next step:
  - [ ] Gather missing context from the operator to finalize the improvement brief.
