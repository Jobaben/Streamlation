# Brief

## Problem statement
- The operator wants an analysis of the existing solution and a brief of all improvements needed to actualize the app, but the current state of the app and success criteria are not described.
- Without clarity on the app’s purpose, users, and current gaps, it is not possible to define a meaningful improvement brief.

## Goals
- Produce a clear, non-technical improvement brief that enumerates the areas needing refinement to make the app production-ready.
- Align stakeholders on desired outcomes, scope boundaries, and success signals for “actualizing” the app.
- Identify the user-facing scenarios that must be supported for launch readiness.

## Non-goals
- No technical design, architecture, or implementation details.
- No selection of tools, frameworks, or deployment targets.

## Users/scenarios
- Product owner or stakeholder requesting the improvement brief to drive the app toward release readiness.
- Teams consuming the brief to prioritize user-visible improvements and define acceptance criteria.

## Constraints
- Brief must stay non-technical and avoid proposing specific architectures or technologies.
- The improvement brief must be grounded in the operator-provided context about the app’s purpose, users, and current shortcomings.

## Edge cases
- The app’s current functionality or intended users are undocumented, making improvement needs ambiguous.
- Conflicting stakeholder expectations about what “actualizing” the app entails (e.g., prototype vs. production readiness).

## Open questions
- What is the app’s purpose and current feature set?
- Who are the primary users and what key scenarios must be supported?
- What problems or gaps are currently blocking real-world use?
- What does “actualizing” mean in this context (MVP readiness, production launch, internal pilot)?
- What measurable outcomes define success?
- What is explicitly out of scope for this improvement brief?
